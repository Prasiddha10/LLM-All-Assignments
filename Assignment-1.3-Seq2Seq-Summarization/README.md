Neural Text Summarization Model
A sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism for automatic text summarization, built with TensorFlow and Keras.
Overview
This project implements a bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanism for text summarization. The model can take an article or long text as input and generate a concise, meaningful summary.
Features

Bidirectional LSTM encoder to capture context from both directions
Attention mechanism to focus on relevant parts of the input text
Beam search decoding for better summary generation
BLEU and ROUGE metrics for evaluation
Visualization of training metrics

Requirements

Python 3.8+
TensorFlow 2.10+
NumPy
Pandas
NLTK
Rouge
Matplotlib

Installation
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/text-summarization.git
cd text-summarization

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas nltk rouge matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
You can train the model and generate summaries:
pythonfrom summarization_model import load_sample_data, build_fixed_seq2seq_model, summarize_text

# Train the model
articles, summaries = load_sample_data()
model, encoder_model, decoder_model = build_fixed_seq2seq_model(...)

# Generate a summary
article = "Your article text here..."
summary = summarize_text(article)
print(summary)
Model Architecture

Encoder: Bidirectional LSTM that processes the input article
Attention Mechanism: Additive attention that helps focus on relevant parts of the input
Decoder: LSTM that generates the summary token by token

Example
Input Article:
This is a sample news article that discusses artificial intelligence advancements.
Researchers have developed new techniques for natural language processing that
enable more accurate text summarization. These models can now understand context
better and generate more coherent summaries of longer documents. The implications
for automated content analysis are significant across many industries.
Generated Summary:
Sample output summary will appear here after training the model.
Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:

BLEU score
ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L F1 scores
