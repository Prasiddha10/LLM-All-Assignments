# Fine-Tuning and Parameter-Efficient Methods Experiment

This project demonstrates and compares different fine-tuning strategies for transformer models, focusing on parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA and Adapters. The experiment uses synthetic sentiment analysis data and provides a comprehensive analysis of accuracy, parameter efficiency, and training speed.

## Features

- **Full Fine-Tuning**: Standard approach where all model parameters are updated.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Only low-rank matrices are trained, drastically reducing trainable parameters.
- **Adapters**: Small bottleneck layers are inserted into each transformer layer, with only these adapters being trained.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generates a balanced sentiment dataset for demonstration.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Compares methods on accuracy, parameter count, training time, and efficiency.
- **Visualization**: Plots for accuracy, parameter efficiency, training time, and overall efficiency.

## Project Structure

- `fine-tuning-parameter-efficient-methods-experiment.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all code, experiments, and analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Transformers (HuggingFace)
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy

Install dependencies with:

```sh
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn matplotlib pandas numpy
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Notebook**  
   Open `fine-tuning-parameter-efficient-methods-experiment.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and execute all cells.

2. **Experiment Steps**
   - Synthetic data is generated for sentiment analysis.
   - Three models are trained: Full Fine-Tuning, LoRA, and Adapters.
   - Results are analyzed and visualized, with practical recommendations and suggestions for further research.

3. **Customization**
   - You can modify the synthetic data or replace it with a real dataset.
   - Adjust model hyperparameters (e.g., LoRA rank, adapter size) in the experiment class.

## Key Insights

- Parameter-efficient methods (LoRA, Adapters) achieve similar accuracy to full fine-tuning with a fraction of the trainable parameters and faster training.
- LoRA and Adapters are recommended for most production and research scenarios due to their efficiency.

## Next Steps

- Try with real-world datasets (IMDB, SST, AG News).
- Experiment with larger transformer models.
- Explore additional PEFT methods (Prefix Tuning, BitFit).
- Profile resource usage and optimize for deployment.
