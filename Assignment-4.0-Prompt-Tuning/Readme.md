# Assignment 4: Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Overview
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of the Google Gemini API for generating content using various prompt designs. The notebook explores different techniques such as direct prompts, few-shot prompts, and chain-of-thought prompts. Additionally, it includes a section on sentiment analysis and discusses ethical considerations related to large language models.

## Files
- **Assignment_4_LLMs.ipynb**: The main notebook file containing Python code for interacting with the Google Gemini API.

## Instructions
1. **Setup**: 
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
   - Install the required libraries, including `google-generativeai`. You can do this using pip:
     ```
     pip install google-generativeai
     ```

2. **API Key**: 
   - Obtain your API key from Google and replace `"YOUR API KEY HERE"` in the notebook with your actual API key.

3. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Open the `Assignment_4_LLMs.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
   - Execute the cells in the notebook to see the results of the different prompt designs and sentiment analysis.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- google-generativeai

## Ethical Considerations
This project also addresses ethical issues related to the use of large language models, including bias, fairness, and privacy. It is important to consider these factors when developing and deploying AI applications.
